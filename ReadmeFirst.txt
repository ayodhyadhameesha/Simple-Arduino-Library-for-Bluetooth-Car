*This is a small library implemented to make a simple project in arduino which is the bluetooth car.

*This library is used to control the motor drive of the bluetooth car.

*The functions will move the car to front,back,right,left &stop.

*The functions in this library are described below.
#pinSetups()-Assigns the pins of the arduino to library variables
#Carforward()-Moves the car forward
#Carbackward()-Moves the car backward
#Carright()-Moves the car right
#Carleft()-Moves the car left
#Carstop()- Stops the car

*The IN1,IN2,ENA pins should be given to the left wheel
*The IN3,IN4,ENB pins should be given to the right wheel

*This library can be used to obstacle avoiding robots also.
